JavaScript based image frame player with full manual controls. Able to be 
used from most web browsers. This is useful, for example, for visualizing 
frame by frame output from iterative algorithms in a web browser or as a 
photo player.

======= installation =========

Simply download all files and launch image_player_sample.html 
in a web browser to operate the frame player with the included 
sample images.


======= using your own image frames =========

First, one must generate image frames. See the sample images/ directory 
for an example. Obviously, all frames must be the same size to play 
smoothly. There are many ways to generate such frames, for example, 
to save an image during every iteration (or 10 iterations) of an iterative 
algorithm. Of course this can also be used with unrelated photos and 
for presentation purposes.

After the image frames are generated, one must make an html file like 
image_player_sample.html which references the location of the image files. 
I.e.:

<input type="hidden" id="slideshow_image_path_js" name="slideshow_image_path" value="images/" />

Other options, like the default speed can also be set this way in the html file.
